# VBA Collection

This repository contents my personal collection of the VBA code that I've used in some projects along my daily jobs. I've generally worked with VBA code in MsExcel, but it's possible to solve some automation problems with VBA for MsAccess, MsOutlook, MsPowerPoint and MsWord.

## MsExcel VBA
- <b>Cell percentage variation controls:</b><br>
  This code autofits the position of control forms and increase/decrease the value of a percentage value.<br>
